# CLG ASSIGNMENT 3
Lesson 4 - Javascript

INSTRUCTIONS
Declare and execute multiple functions which carry out various tasks

Remember, you can use the if statements and/or expressions you’ve written in previous lessons and refactor them into functions to clean and consolidate your code

Try to also write new functions to return new information to the console

As an added bonus, try passing some arguments and parameters to your functions

Here’s some instructional guides based on the assumption you’re creating either a portfolio site, a catalogue website or an informational page.

A basic function which returns expressions to the console

Create a variable for each category of work, items, or cities you wish to display on your website

Declare a function, for each category, which contains an expression that logs a descriptive sentence using that category variable to your console

Call the functions so that they are executed

A function containing if statements which returns a value back into the code

Set a variable that contains numerical data. Imagine you’re defining an hour of day from 1-24

Declare a function which checks if the hour of day is in the AM or PM (e.g. if (time >= 12) would check if it’s the AM)

If it’s the AM, write a return statement to log a message to the console

If it’s the PM (greater than 12), return a different expression

Execute the function (execute it from within a separate function to take your assignment to the next level)
