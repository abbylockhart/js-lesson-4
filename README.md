# CLG ASSIGNMENT 3
Lesson 3 - Javascript

INSTRUCTIONS
Taking your variables from the last lesson assignment, use them to write expressions using various operators and operands. Use at least 2 operators from the following categories:

Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %, ++, –)

Comparison Operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, =,

Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)

Use the various expressions you’ve written to output new data values to the console. E.g. output your portfolio items, favourite films or local restaurants.

Create statements (block, if/else, etc) and return value(s) in the console.
